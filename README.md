# FlowCycle Pump

**Automated 30-Minute Cyclic Pump Controller Using Arduino UNO**

![FlowCycle Pump Prototype](images/start-view.png)

## Project Overview

The **FlowCycle Pump** is an Arduino-based controller designed to automate precise cyclic timing intervals for laboratory pump operations. It was developed as part of a scientific study at the Center for Health Sciences (CCS) at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Brazil.

### Technical vision
This project implements a 30-minute cyclic timer that switches a pump on and off at predefined intervals, providing visual feedback on an LCD and LEDs. The cycle only starts — or restarts — when the user presses the button, allowing flexible pausing during and between runs.

### Scientific Context

| Item | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| **Research title (pt-br)**  | **“Avaliação da capacidade oncoprotetora do CR35 em um modelo experimental in vivo de câncer de pulmão associado ao tabagismo”** |
| **Research title (en)**     | **“Oncoprotective capacity of CR35 in an _in‑vivo_ cigarette‑smoke‑associated lung‑cancer model”** |
| **Scientific goal**         | Evaluate whether the thiazolidine‑2,4‑dione derivative **CR35** can prevent lung‑tumor formation in mice exposed to cigarette smoke and urethane, and investigate whether this protection involves modulation of the inflammasome pathway. |
| **Circuit need**            | Automation the repetitive manual dosing procedures required by researchers, improving experimental consistency and freeing researchers from manual intervention.|

## Features

- **Automated Timing:** Precise pump cycling intervals (default: 2 seconds ON / 30 seconds OFF for 30 minutes).
- **Flexible Pausing:** Pause cycle during and between runs, which also will inform at what time did you pause it.
- **One-button Operation:** Simple user interface for starting and restarting cycles.
- **LCD Feedback:** Real-time status updates and countdown timers (MM:SS format).
- **LED Indicators:** Visual status indication (Green LED: Pump ON, Red LED: Pump OFF, Yellow LED: End of 30 minutes cycle and Pause state).
- **Isolated Power Supply:** Dedicated 6×AA battery pack for the pump ensures reliable operation without interference.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Assembly

Follow the detailed schematic and layout provided in:

- **Schematic PDF:** [docs/Schematic_View.pdf](https://github.com/Shellyda/flowcycle-pump/blob/f4197e52466bc491275a64fc59c0bba13ee9d35c/docs)
- **Breadboard Layout:** [images/circuit-off.png](https://github.com/Shellyda/flowcycle-pump/blob/f4197e52466bc491275a64fc59c0bba13ee9d35c/images/circuit-off.png)

### Uploading the Firmware

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shellyda/flowcycle-pump.git
```

2. Open [FlowCyclePump.ino](https://github.com/Shellyda/flowcycle-pump/blob/f4197e52466bc491275a64fc59c0bba13ee9d35c/src) or [display-liquid-crystal-for-4-pins/main.ino](https://github.com/Shellyda/flowcycle-pump/blob/main/src/display-liquid-crystal-for-4-pins/main.ino) from the `src` folder in Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the sketch to your Arduino UNO.

### Operating Instructions

- Press the push-button once to initiate the automatic cycle (default: 2 seconds ON / 30 seconds OFF for 30 minutes).
- After the cycle ends (30 minutes), the system waits 1 minute and then prompts the user to restart by pressing the button again.
